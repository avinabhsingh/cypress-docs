# 📄 What is the POM Framework?

POM stands for **Page Object Model**, a design pattern commonly used in test automation to enhance the structure and maintainability of test code. It works by creating an abstraction of web pages so that the test logic is separated from the UI structure.

In a Cypress-based POM framework, each page or component of the application is represented by its own file. These **Page Object** files include:
- **Selectors** (locators) for the page elements
- **Reusable methods** for interacting with those elements

Test scripts interact with these methods instead of directly referencing selectors. This keeps the test code clean and easy to understand.

### ✅ Benefits of Using POM in Cypress:
- **Maintainability**: If the UI changes, only the page object file needs to be updated—not every test.
  
- **Reusability**: Common interactions (like logging in) can be reused across multiple test cases.

- **Readability**: Tests are more readable because they use descriptive method names rather than raw selectors.
- 
- **Scalability**: As the application grows, the organized structure makes it easier to scale test coverage.

### 📁 Typical Structure:
- `cypress/pages/` – contains page object files
- `cypress/e2e/` – contains test scripts

This structure improves collaboration among team members by providing a clear separation of concerns: developers and testers can focus on writing test logic, while updates to locators are handled within the page object files.

In summary, implementing the POM framework in Cypress leads to a cleaner, more robust, and scalable automation test suite.
