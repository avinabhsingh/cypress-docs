### 4. Customize Reporter Options (Optional)

You can customize the reporter's behavior and output in the `cypress.config.js` file by adding the following `reporterOptions` section. This allows you to control various aspects like charts, report filename, and whether to overwrite existing reports:

```js
reporterOptions: {
  charts: true,                // Enables charts for test results.
  reportFilename: 'Report',    // Specifies the name of the report file.
  overwrite: false,            // Prevents overwriting of existing reports.
  html: true,                  // Generates HTML report.
}
```
