
# ðŸ§© Implementation of POM Framework in Cypress

Follow the steps below to implement the **Page Object Model (POM)** framework in your Cypress project:

---

### 1. Create the Page Objects Directory

Inside your Cypress project, create a folder named:

`cypress/Page_Objects`

> **Note:** This folder will store all your page object files.

---

### 2. Create a JavaScript Page Object File

Within the `Page_Objects` folder, create a JavaScript file corresponding to the web page or component. For example:

`google.js`

![Page Objects Folder](images/Page-Objects-Folder.png)

> **Note:** Make sure the file has a `.js` extension.

---

### 3. Define UI Locators and Reusable Methods

Inside `google.js`, define:
- **Element locators** (selectors)
- **Reusable methods** (for interactions you perform often)

![UI Locators](images/UI_locators.png)

This helps in keeping your test logic clean and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

### 4. Export and Import Page Object Class

Export the class from your `GooglePage.js` file using ES6 syntax:

```js
export default new GooglePage();
```

Then, import it into your test spec file (e.g., sample_file.cy.js) like this:

```js
import google from '../../pageobjects/GooglePage';
```

This allows you to directly use the `google` object to access methods and locators from the page object file.

##### Why We Use ES6 (ECMAScript 6)

In our Cypress project, we use ES6 syntax (e.g., export default, import) to structure code in a clean and modern way. ES6 helps us:

- Keep files modular and organized using import/export.

- Write more readable and reusable code.

- Leverage features like classes, arrow functions, and constants for better maintainability.

Most modern tools and browsers support ES6, making it a best practice for automation frameworks like Cypress.

### 5. Use OOP Principles

Since we exported an instance of the class, we donâ€™t need to create a new object. We can directly use the imported `google` instance:

```js
google.search('Cypress Testing');
google.validateTitle('Cypress');
```

This approach promotes reusability and follows object-oriented programming principles.

### 6. View Test Execution Result

Once the test is executed, Cypress will show the test run summary which includes:

Status: Pass / Fail

Execution time

Step-by-step commands run in the browser
